% Pattern A -> B implies event B depends on event A such that:
%
%   - A must occur before first occurrence of B
%
%   - After first occurrence of A, it can recur only after B has occurred
%     exactly once
%
%   - After first occurrence of B, it can recur only after A has occurred
%     exactly once

dep( 1 -> 2 ).


% Similar to above example. Just that in pattern A -> B,  A is an Exclusive Or
% of events i.e. exactly 1 of them should occur. Note that ^ has higher
% precedence than ->.

dep( 3 ^ 4 -> 5 ).


% Similar to above example. Just that, in pattern A -> B, here B uses Exclusive
% Or of events.

dep( 6 -> 7 ^ 8 ).
